# valorant-and-fortnite-unban
EFI unban method that i worked on works for Valorant/Fortnite
download rufus and windows 10 iso ( create local account to save time )
boot through usb when rufus is done
when reinstalling windows clear all partitions in drive update and download windows to your drive that you usually have it on
after reinstalling windows and get on home screen download dcontrol and turn off your antivirus
after downloaded dcontrol download a diffrent verstion of your bios and flash your bios twice ( avoid tpm checks )
make sure secure boot, tpm.msc and hvci/svm/vbs is off
after you have reinstalled windows, cleared partitions, flashed bios twice format a usb to FAT32
in the usb you are going to put the EFI files in there and then boot your computer from the usb
add my discord @ynrex for EFI files and enjoy the unban :)
